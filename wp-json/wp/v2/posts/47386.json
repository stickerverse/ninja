We have sales tax news: Due to changes in state laws\/us reaching a nexus threshold for paying taxes, we\u2019re now required to collect sales tax on certain purchases in specific states (\u1d17_ \u1d17\u3002)<br \/>\nHere\u2019s a quick rundown of what\u2019s behind these changes, which states are affected, and how this might impact you. If you are someone who is tax exempt, please find info below as well!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why the Change?<\/strong><br \/>\nThis update is a result of a 2018 Supreme Court decision in <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/South_Dakota_v._Wayfair,_Inc.\">South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc.<\/a> In short, this decision allows states to require businesses to collect sales tax based on the volume of sales within that state, even if the business isn\u2019t physically located there. Since then, most states have adopted what\u2019s called <em>\u201ceconomic nexus\u201d<\/em> laws, meaning if a business reaches a certain sales or transaction threshold in a state, they\u2019re required to collect sales tax.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Which States Are Impacted?<\/strong><br \/>\nMany states now have their own rules around sales tax collection, with some differences:<\/p>\n<p><em>Economic Nexus Thresholds:<\/em> Most states set a minimum amount threshold. If we reach that threshold in your state, we\u2019re required to collect sales tax on purchases.<\/p>\n<p><em>Different Tax Rules for Different States:<\/em> Sales tax rates and regulations vary, so depending on where you are, you might see these charges show up differently.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What Does This Mean for You?<\/strong><br \/>\nIf you\u2019re in a state where these new requirements apply, you\u2019ll start to see sales tax on applicable purchases. To keep things as smooth as possible, we\u2019re using automated tools that calculate the correct tax rate for your location.
