It means we\u2019re a small business and have to create some sort of balance within our business, so our team doesn\u2019t become overloaded with the amount of orders we need to process! Within capitalism, forever growth is encouraged- just keep taking on more and more, and just keep growing your business until it\u2019s a large corporation that has no semblance of its original beginnings. We don\u2019t want that for Sticker Ninja. We want a balance of being able to give a quality service to our (lovey af) customers, as well as keeping in mind the work-load that our employees have to process each day. This is also the reason our website is closed on <a href=\"https:\/\/stickerninja.com\/blog\/website-closed-on-sundays\/\">Sundays<\/a>, so our prepress team doesn\u2019t come to work on Mondays and be completely bombarded with the amount of orders that need to be processed from over the weekend. Humans don\u2019t need to work full-speed-ahead all of the time, it\u2019s important to pace yourself, and if we have the means to control how our company does things, we\u2019re gonna do it! <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So every now and then, our website will be offline because we\u2019re sold out of stickers for the day! If we\u2019re maxed out on orders, then we gotta slow our roll. We love offering our customers a quality customer service experience! Some of y\u2019all have been ordering with us for YEARS and it\u2019s important to us that we have the time to help you all with your sticker needs \u2661 It\u2019s also important as heck to us to offer a quality product! We care so much about stickers, that it\u2019s goofy. We want to put a quality product out into the world, because quality matters!!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As always, our intention is quality over quantity and thank you thank you thank you to all the folks who support our business and the energy we\u2019re trying to put out into the world. We appreciate everyone who knows we\u2019re worth the wait and doesn\u2019t mind coming back the next day to place an order with us. Y\u2019alls support over the years has taken us to where we are today, and we are so grateful for it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u201cWhat do ya mean you\u2019re sold out of stickers???!\u201d You may be wondering what the heck that means.
