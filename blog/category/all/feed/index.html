As some of y&#8217;all might recall, back in 2020, we made the decision to close our websites on Sundays!<br />
[<a href="https://stickerninja.com/blog/website-closed-on-sundays/">blog post from that era in time here</a>]</p>
<p>tbh, this is one of our favorite business practices! It really allows breathing room for our team to not be overloaded with processing orders on Mondays, allowing us the ability to give better care and attention to y&#8217;all&#8217;s beautiful artwork! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f970.png" alt="ü•∞" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Fun fact: we do all our white ink layers by hand!! While this may be fairly time consuming, the finished result is more than worth it ‚ô°</p>
<p>Producing high quality stickers is very important to us and the ability to close our website on Sundays give us more ability to offer a better, friendlier service.</p>
<p>Thank you for supporting our business! We are forever grateful for the love, kindness, and compassion folks show us and it truly makes a difference in our lives ‚ô°</p>

<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-39346" src="https://stickerninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ColorMorphGif.gif" alt="" width="800" height="347" srcset="https://stickerninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ColorMorphGif.gif 1056w, https://stickerninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ColorMorphGif-768x333.gif 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When ordering stickers with our Color Morph material, there are a couple things to consider first before going forward¬†with this option!</span></p>
<hr />
<h3><span style="color: #ff13b3;"><b>It‚Äôs Morphin‚Äô Time!</b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This material has two different color states! The material‚Äôs </span><b>warm state</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (the usual color that it will be seen with if you live some place mostly warm!) is a vibrant pink, and when the material gets below 59¬∞F, it begins to change color to its </span><b>cold state</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of an electric purple.</span><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-38442" src="https://stickerninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Temp_States-1.png" alt="" width="481" height="500" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Sticker Design Feedback!!</strong><br />
Color Morph works the absolute best with art that contains white lines vs black! In our sticker opinion, we suggest avoiding black and darker colors with this material, as when the sticker enters its cold state, the darker colors can become almost completely lost. The white lines create more contrast and make for a more aesthetically pleasing sticker! See below for examples!<br />
</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-38468" src="https://stickerninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Color_Morph_Black-1.png" alt="" width="738" height="450" srcset="https://stickerninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Color_Morph_Black-1.png 1189w, https://stickerninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Color_Morph_Black-1-768x468.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 738px) 100vw, 738px" /></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-38467" src="https://stickerninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Color_Morph_White-1.png" alt="" width="750" height="402" srcset="https://stickerninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Color_Morph_White-1.png 1351w, https://stickerninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Color_Morph_White-1-768x412.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Please note:</strong> If the submitted artwork contains black lines, there&#8217;s a very good chance we can easily convert them to white lines on our end using Illustrator magic! W</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">e‚Äôll reach out via email if we need anything else! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="üôÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Head‚Äôs up that even the white ink gets affected by the color morph material! White ink layers still take on the color of the vinyl it&#8217;s being printed on. Because of this, we‚Äôre unable to achieve a true white with this material! The colors below are screenshots from areas that had only white ink on them. As you can see, there‚Äôs a bit of pink/purple tint to these whites!¬†</span><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-38440 aligncenter" src="https://stickerninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/White_Ink_Temp_States-1.png" alt="" width="535" height="331" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5>New Sales Tax Requirements for Certain States</h5>
<p>Hello sticker friends! We have sales tax news: Due to changes in state laws/us reaching a nexus threshold for paying taxes, we‚Äôre now required to collect sales tax on certain purchases in specific states (·¥ó_ ·¥ó„ÄÇ)<br />
Here‚Äôs a quick rundown of what‚Äôs behind these changes, which states are affected, and how this might impact you. If you are someone who is tax exempt, please find info below as well!</p>
<p><strong>Why the Change?</strong><br />
This update is a result of a 2018 Supreme Court decision in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota_v._Wayfair,_Inc.">South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc.</a> In short, this decision allows states to require businesses to collect sales tax based on the volume of sales within that state, even if the business isn‚Äôt physically located there. Since then, most states have adopted what‚Äôs called <em>‚Äúeconomic nexus‚Äù</em> laws, meaning if a business reaches a certain sales or transaction threshold in a state, they‚Äôre required to collect sales tax.</p>
<p><strong>Which States Are Impacted?</strong><br />
Many states now have their own rules around sales tax collection, with some differences:</p>
<p><em>Economic Nexus Thresholds:</em> Most states set a minimum amount threshold. If we reach that threshold in your state, we‚Äôre required to collect sales tax on purchases.</p>
<p><em>Different Tax Rules for Different States:</em> Sales tax rates and regulations vary, so depending on where you are, you might see these charges show up differently.</p>
<p><strong>What Does This Mean for You?</strong><br />
If you‚Äôre in a state where these new requirements apply, you‚Äôll start to see sales tax on applicable purchases. To keep things as smooth as possible, we‚Äôre using automated tools that calculate the correct tax rate for your location. So if this ruling applies to you, you will see sales tax during check out.</p>
<h4><strong>Tax Exempt</strong></h4>
<p>If you are a business who is tax exempt, please <a href="https://stickerninja.com/contact/">Contact Us</a> with your tax exempt form and we can get you all set up in our system!¬†<strong><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let&#8217;s talk about printing greens!</p>
<p>Green colors in your artwork (and especially neons!) will print out <em>somewhat</em> different than intended than most other colors.</p>
<p>When there are colors that are both super vivid and super bright (neons and pastels), they are most likely going to shift in print. This is because there has to be more colored pigment added in order to get it vibrant. The more colored pigment that has to be added, the darker it gets! Because of that, neon green colors <strong>especially</strong> are going to go through the biggest shift from screen to print, and trend towards printing darker and less saturated than they appear on screen.</p>
<p>Please note, printing <strong>actual</strong> neon colors is only possible with specialized printers! Neon colors can only be achieved with neon ink cartridges.</p>
<p>**If you&#8217;re nervous about how your colors will print out, we always recommend ordering a <a href="https://stickerninja.com/product/custom-samples/">sample run</a>!**</p>
<p>Please note, that due to the nature of the print world, it&#8217;s very likely your colors will appear different once printed then how they do on the screen! Going with a sample run to test colors will best ensure you know what you&#8217;re getting, if you need to be particular about colors <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="üôÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s some swatch examples to compare greens to each other on-screen (RGB Format) and on our Matte &amp; Glossy options! ^-^</p>
<p><strong>On-Screen Colors (RGB Format):<br />
</strong></p>
<p>This is the digital version of the artwork! This is what you will see on your monitor.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-31576 aligncenter" src="https://stickerninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Green-Swatch-Examples.png" alt="On-Screen Colors (RGB Format)" width="611" height="429" srcset="https://stickerninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Green-Swatch-Examples.png 2322w, https://stickerninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Green-Swatch-Examples-768x538.png 768w, https://stickerninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Green-Swatch-Examples-1536x1076.png 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 611px) 100vw, 611px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Printed out and Laminated with a Matte Laminate:</strong></p>
<p>This version has been printed out and can be compared to the digital version above.<br />
Please note that the matte laminate also changes how the colors are perceived! Compare with both the digital version, as well as the glossy laminated version below.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-31573 aligncenter" src="https://stickerninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Green-Swatch-Examples-Matte.png" alt="Laminated with Matte (Printer's CMYK Conversions)" width="612" height="428" srcset="https://stickerninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Green-Swatch-Examples-Matte.png 2322w, https://stickerninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Green-Swatch-Examples-Matte-768x538.png 768w, https://stickerninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Green-Swatch-Examples-Matte-1536x1076.png 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" /></p>
<p><strong><br />
Printed out and Laminated with a Glossy Laminate:</strong></p>
<p>Here is the printed out, glossy laminated version!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-31574 aligncenter" src="https://stickerninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Green-Swatch-Examples-Glossy.png" alt="Laminated with Glossy (Printer's CMYK Conversions)" width="612" height="429" srcset="https://stickerninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Green-Swatch-Examples-Glossy.png 2322w, https://stickerninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Green-Swatch-Examples-Glossy-768x538.png 768w, https://stickerninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Green-Swatch-Examples-Glossy-1536x1076.png 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We hope these examples offer guidance on what to expect with printing greens!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúWhat do ya mean you‚Äôre sold out of stickers???!‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may be wondering what the heck that means. It means we‚Äôre a small business and have to create some sort of balance within our business, so our team doesn‚Äôt become overloaded with the amount of orders we need to process! Within capitalism, forever growth is encouraged- just keep taking on more and more, and just keep growing your business until it‚Äôs a large corporation that has no semblance of its original beginnings. We don‚Äôt want that for Sticker Ninja. We want a balance of being able to give a quality service to our (lovey af) customers, as well as keeping in mind the work-load that our employees have to process each day. This is also the reason our website is closed on <a href="https://stickerninja.com/blog/website-closed-on-sundays/">Sundays</a>, so our prepress team doesn‚Äôt come to work on Mondays and be completely bombarded with the amount of orders that need to be processed from over the weekend. Humans don‚Äôt need to work full-speed-ahead all of the time, it‚Äôs important to pace yourself, and if we have the means to control how our company does things, we‚Äôre gonna do it! </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So every now and then, our website will be offline because we‚Äôre sold out of stickers for the day! If we‚Äôre maxed out on orders, then we gotta slow our roll. We love offering our customers a quality customer service experience! Some of y‚Äôall have been ordering with us for YEARS and it‚Äôs important to us that we have the time to help you all with your sticker needs ‚ô° It‚Äôs also important as heck to us to offer a quality product! We care so much about stickers, that it‚Äôs goofy. We want to put a quality product out into the world, because quality matters!!¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As always, our intention is quality over quantity and thank you thank you thank you to all the folks who support our business and the energy we‚Äôre trying to put out into the world. We appreciate everyone who knows we‚Äôre worth the wait and doesn‚Äôt mind coming back the next day to place an order with us. Y‚Äôalls support over the years has taken us to where we are today, and we are so grateful for it.¬†</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hello everyone! Elena here with some exciting news!! </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">After years of putting things in motion, Sticker Ninja as a business has finally implemented a 4 day work week for our employees :‚Äô) This is something that has been on my radar for the last three years, and through much hard work and logistical planning, the fruits of our labor have come to fruition! </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To preface: for all the folks who order stickers through us, nothing public facing will change ‚ô° Our hours will stay the same and production time has not been affected. As far as anyone who uses our sticker services can tell, nothing has changed at all <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="üôÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I look into the future of our society, I am also looking into the past. And in the past, I see all the humans who came before us and who worked and sacrificed so much so we can have the type of lives that we live today. We are all intertwined in this way, past and future. Through learning history, we remember, and 115 years ago, workers in the United States first gained a 5 day work week, so Jewish workers would not have to work on the Sabbath. 18 years later, Henry Ford began shutting his factories down on Saturday and Sunday due to pressures stemming from the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_Revolution"><span style="font-weight: 400;">October Revolution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which witnessed the ruling class persecuted for not giving the laborers dignifying conditions. It was not until 1940, that a 40-hour workweek went into effect, and the two-day weekend was adopted nationwide. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">83 years have passed, and the 5 day work week still prevails, regardless of how far society has come with automation during that time. Why, as a society, are we not making the progressive steps towards change? The elites cling to the old world as if it‚Äôs a tattered old baby blanket. They invest in automation, not because it will make their workers&#8217; lives easier, but because profits will be greater. Greed is a by-product produced by Capitalism, and our society is plagued with the illness. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Summer of 2020, we experienced a huge amount of growth as a business. To give you an idea of where we were at, at the beginning of 2020, we had 5 people on the whole team, including Justin and myself. And as I type this now, Sticker Ninja has 16 people on the whole team. </span><a href="https://stickerninja.com/about/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">16 people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">!!!¬† </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over these last 3 years, Sticker Ninja has invested heavily in automation. If something can be automated within our business, we make the moves to make it happen. So many of the seeds we planted years ago have sprouted and it feels really great to witness the hard work paying off. Because of the moves we have made within our business, it has set us up to be able to implement a 4 day work week! </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our 4 day work week has kept the take home pay the same, and features staggered day offs for our team, so there should always be coverage in each department. Our team has done a great job of cross training, which has really set us up for success in taking turns of people having days off. I am so proud of where our team is, and how far we‚Äôve come.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a responsibility that comes with running a business. We are essentially taking people&#8217;s hard earned money, and not only producing stickers, but we use that money to pay our employees, invest in automation, and a whole myriad of other bills that come with running a business. In many ways, I feel like I owe something to all the people that support our silly little sticker printing business. Without y‚Äôalls support, we wouldn‚Äôt be where we‚Äôre at. I try my hardest to do right by my moral compass, and have spent countless sleepless nights wondering how I can do things better, how I can create change that influences the future. It‚Äôs my hope that if a goofy sticker printing small business can implement a 4 day work week, then what‚Äôs stopping the rest of the world from following suit? Our ancestors worked too damn hard for us not to progress as a society. Time is our most precious nonrenewable resource and we all deserve a little resty rest. While Capitalism feels like this huge level 99 boss fight that we are up against, I feel like the real power comes down to each of us creating change in whatever sphere we find ourselves in. It is within these small changes, that big change is possible. ¬† </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you for taking the time to read this. And for choosing to spend your money with our business. And for the kind words you send our way. You all have changed our lives in so many ways and we out here trying to give that back ‚ô°</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

There&#8217;s plenty of websites where you easily generate a code and we often see artwork come through with a code as part of the artwork. Because the code is something that a phone&#8217;s camera will need to scan, we need to make sure it&#8217;s big enough once it prints out! Otherwise the code won&#8217;t work, and that&#8217;s just sad :&#8217;)</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve tested QR code heights to see how small we can go, and a code size of .3x.3&#8243; is the smallest we can go with the codes still working! Like everything else we print, it will need to be a minimum of 300 DPI <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="üôÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><strong>QR codes work best if they are on a white background!¬†</strong></p>
<p>Hope this information helps! Our trusty prepress folks will reach out if we notice your QR code being smaller than .3&#8243;! ‚ô°</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hello friends!! as springtime smells fill the air, I‚Äôve been reflecting on the past year of sticker ninja <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f495.png" alt="üíï" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> personally, springtime is the beginning of the year/cycle (having a new year start in the dead of winter is a system of oppression af <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f612.png" alt="üòí" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> and that‚Äôs coming from a capricorn lol) and it‚Äôs a great time for reflecting! I think it‚Äôs so important to share our growth recaps with y‚Äôall, since soooo many of y‚Äôall invest your hard earned money with us!! I know talking about money can feel weird, but I like to see money as an energy exchange and this is the amount of energy we are putting back into the world through human beings on our team <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f495.png" alt="üíï" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> We are very passionate about the people we hire and invest time into cultivating a team that is reflective of our values.</p>
<p>In the 2021 we invested $462,000 on payroll!! like excuse me??? back in 2017 it was literally just 2 people making everything happen at sticker ninja and now the team has grown to 16 people. sometimes it‚Äôs hard to reflect on where we‚Äôve come in the last 5 years, because we be in the THICK of it a lot (running a biz is hard <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f629.png" alt="üò©" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />) but when i stop to look back, my heart friggin swells and i feel so proud of how far we‚Äôve come. we‚Äôre like&#8230; just normal-ass people who managed to have this amazing business producing stickers, have a wonderful team, and are so supported by amazing people? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f97a.png" alt="ü•∫" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>We are literally where we are because of everyone who supports us. I know we are ‚Äújust‚Äù printing stickers, but y‚Äôall could go anywhere and y‚Äôall choose us. I wish I had fancier words to express my gratitude. In a time where capitalism feels very gross, and times are turbulent, my hope is that the way we run a business will somehow echo into the future. sincerely, thank you for the support, especially during 2020 when we had no idea where we were headed. at the end of this year, we will be moving (again <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="üòÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f629.png" alt="üò©" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />) so stay tuned for updates when we learn more!! this spot should be our final home (after having 4 spots in the last 5 years lol) and I can‚Äôt wait to help cultivate a new space <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f495.png" alt="üíï" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> here‚Äôs to new cycles!!!</p>
<p>sending you all love and gratitude <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f49c.png" alt="üíú" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The top mission of Sticker Ninja is to make the best stickers ever!! Our passion for stickers stems from our childhood of collecting, trading, and hoarding (albeit nicely in binders) loads and loads of stickers. Our drive to make stickers that don‚Äôt rub off, don‚Äôt fade in the sun, and are waterproof comes from our time spent out at festivals, where rough terrains quickly break down any sticker that isn‚Äôt up to the challenge of those environments. Nothing is sadder than seeing a rubbed off sticker, where only a white piece of vinyl remains on your special water bottle.</p>
<p>Not only did these festivals inspire our passion for hardy stickers, but they ignited our souls for appreciating interactive art, leadership, working as a team, and the drive to make the world a nicer place by seeing how it can be if we all set our intentions towards a common goal. Burning Man is one of those events that has shaped the way we do business and the¬†10 Principles¬†is something we keep in our minds as we do the capitalistic dance of doing business in America. We believe that maybe there‚Äôs a better way to do capitalism, and part of our mission is finding out what that looks like.</p>
<p>A large belief we have at Sticker Ninja is helping artists spread their art out in the world. We are at a beautiful time in history where stickers even exist and a point in time where individual humans can easily make art and spread it all over the world. We keep our lower quantity pricing low, so artists who are still testing the waters in the artworld, can more easily afford buying quality stickers. We know how scary it can be to invest a lot of money into something like stickers, when it may be hard to justify working something like that into your budget. It feels good to turn your artwork into a sticker that you can share with friends, and we hope to make that experience attainable for all!</p>
<p>Our biggest want and drive for Sticker Ninja is to use our voice to better the world. We have raised money by connecting with artists in putting together stickers packs with all proceeds going towards charity organizations. We raised over $1300 to donate towards the Amazon being on fire in September 2019. We have brought people together to help with a trash clean up day in Portland. We partake in community outreach programs with the hopes to better our community. We invest in the LBGT+ community, POC, and try to help when we can. We want to take the profits we make from Sticker Ninja and send them back out into our community. A stronger community helps everyone. We are passionate about people and the environment and making a better future for those who are following us.</p>
<p>We know you can get your stickers from so many different sticker companies on the internet. But holy moly, it‚Äôs truly an honor getting to do what we do, and being supported by people like you. At the end of the day, every day, we are a bunch of humans trying our hardest and we appreciate the support so much. We hope you resonate with our mission statement, and what we are trying to accomplish in this world.</p>
