										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hello everyone! Elena here with some exciting news!! </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">After years of putting things in motion, Sticker Ninja as a business has finally implemented a 4 day work week for our employees :â€™) This is something that has been on my radar for the last three years, and through much hard work and logistical planning, the fruits of our labor have come to fruition! </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To preface: for all the folks who order stickers through us, nothing public facing will change â™¡ Our hours will stay the same and production time has not been affected. As far as anyone who uses our sticker services can tell, nothing has changed at all <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I look into the future of our society, I am also looking into the past. And in the past, I see all the humans who came before us and who worked and sacrificed so much so we can have the type of lives that we live today. We are all intertwined in this way, past and future. Through learning history, we remember, and 115 years ago, workers in the United States first gained a 5 day work week, so Jewish workers would not have to work on the Sabbath. 18 years later, Henry Ford began shutting his factories down on Saturday and Sunday due to pressures stemming from the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_Revolution"><span style="font-weight: 400;">October Revolution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which witnessed the ruling class persecuted for not giving the laborers dignifying conditions. It was not until 1940, that a 40-hour workweek went into effect, and the two-day weekend was adopted nationwide. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">83 years have passed, and the 5 day work week still prevails, regardless of how far society has come with automation during that time. Why, as a society, are we not making the progressive steps towards change? The elites cling to the old world as if itâ€™s a tattered old baby blanket. They invest in automation, not because it will make their workers&#8217; lives easier, but because profits will be greater. Greed is a by-product produced by Capitalism, and our society is plagued with the illness. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Summer of 2020, we experienced a huge amount of growth as a business. To give you an idea of where we were at, at the beginning of 2020, we had 5 people on the whole team, including Justin and myself. And as I type this now, Sticker Ninja has 16 people on the whole team. </span><a href="https://stickerninja.com/about/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">16 people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">!!!Â  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over these last 3 years, Sticker Ninja has invested heavily in automation. If something can be automated within our business, we make the moves to make it happen. So many of the seeds we planted years ago have sprouted and it feels really great to witness the hard work paying off. Because of the moves we have made within our business, it has set us up to be able to implement a 4 day work week! </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our 4 day work week has kept the take home pay the same, and features staggered day offs for our team, so there should always be coverage in each department. Our team has done a great job of cross training, which has really set us up for success in taking turns of people having days off. I am so proud of where our team is, and how far weâ€™ve come.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a responsibility that comes with running a business. We are essentially taking people&#8217;s hard earned money, and not only producing stickers, but we use that money to pay our employees, invest in automation, and a whole myriad of other bills that come with running a business. In many ways, I feel like I owe something to all the people that support our silly little sticker printing business. Without yâ€™alls support, we wouldnâ€™t be where weâ€™re at. I try my hardest to do right by my moral compass, and have spent countless sleepless nights wondering how I can do things better, how I can create change that influences the future. Itâ€™s my hope that if a goofy sticker printing small business can implement a 4 day work week, then whatâ€™s stopping the rest of the world from following suit? Our ancestors worked too damn hard for us not to progress as a society. Time is our most precious nonrenewable resource and we all deserve a little resty rest. While Capitalism feels like this huge level 99 boss fight that we are up against, I feel like the real power comes down to each of us creating change in whatever sphere we find ourselves in. It is within these small changes, that big change is possible. Â  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you for taking the time to read this. And for choosing to spend your money with our business. And for the kind words you send our way. You all have changed our lives in so many ways and we out here trying to give that back â™¡</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

Since the early days of Sticker Ninja we&#8217;ve had a goal to create the highest quality custom stickers. This is a little tricky for custom dimensions since they require our utmost attention to detail, assessment in cost, and manual invoicing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>For the month of November,</h1>
<p>we did something special and held a sticker based donation campaign! We&#8217;re very passionate about using our voice and raising money for charities who are doing awesome work, and the first charity we chose wasÂ <a href="https://thehoneybeeconservancy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Honeybee Conservancy</a>. They work to createÂ habitats for bees, bring bee education to schools and communities, and partner with gardens and urban farms to helpÂ build a greener, more sustainable world. We love the work that they do!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The artwork for the stickers come from a High School senior project who created a variety of stickers to back different charities. More info can be found <a href="https://www.instagram.com/knl_stickers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. We loved their artwork so much that we reached out and explained about wanting to do a donation drive and they agreed! They are still raising money so if you missed out on getting a sticker through us, you can purchase one from them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>We happy to announce that we raised $175 to be donated to <a href="https://thehoneybeeconservancy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Honeybee Conservancy!</a></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you all who purchased a sticker! We love getting to connect the world of sticker making and art, and combing it with helping charities who are passionate about what they do!

<p>&nbsp;</p>
