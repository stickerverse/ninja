										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let&#8217;s talk about printing greens!</p>
<p>Green colors in your artwork (and especially neons!) will print out <em>somewhat</em> different than intended than most other colors.</p>
<p>When there are colors that are both super vivid and super bright (neons and pastels), they are most likely going to shift in print. This is because there has to be more colored pigment added in order to get it vibrant. The more colored pigment that has to be added, the darker it gets! Because of that, neon green colors <strong>especially</strong> are going to go through the biggest shift from screen to print, and trend towards printing darker and less saturated than they appear on screen.</p>
<p>Please note, printing <strong>actual</strong> neon colors is only possible with specialized printers! Neon colors can only be achieved with neon ink cartridges.</p>
<p>**If you&#8217;re nervous about how your colors will print out, we always recommend ordering a <a href="https://stickerninja.com/product/custom-samples/">sample run</a>!**</p>
<p>Please note, that due to the nature of the print world, it&#8217;s very likely your colors will appear different once printed then how they do on the screen! Going with a sample run to test colors will best ensure you know what you&#8217;re getting, if you need to be particular about colors <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="üôÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s some swatch examples to compare greens to each other on-screen (RGB Format) and on our Matte &amp; Glossy options! ^-^</p>
<p><strong>On-Screen Colors (RGB Format):<br />
</strong></p>
<p>This is the digital version of the artwork! This is what you will see on your monitor.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-31576 aligncenter" src="https://stickerninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Green-Swatch-Examples.png" alt="On-Screen Colors (RGB Format)" width="611" height="429" srcset="https://stickerninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Green-Swatch-Examples.png 2322w, https://stickerninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Green-Swatch-Examples-768x538.png 768w, https://stickerninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Green-Swatch-Examples-1536x1076.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 611px) 100vw, 611px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Printed out and Laminated with a Matte Laminate:</strong></p>
<p>This version has been printed out and can be compared to the digital version above.<br />
Please note that the matte laminate also changes how the colors are perceived! Compare with both the digital version, as well as the glossy laminated version below.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-31573 aligncenter" src="https://stickerninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Green-Swatch-Examples-Matte.png" alt="Laminated with Matte (Printer's CMYK Conversions)" width="612" height="428" srcset="https://stickerninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Green-Swatch-Examples-Matte.png 2322w, https://stickerninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Green-Swatch-Examples-Matte-768x538.png 768w, https://stickerninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Green-Swatch-Examples-Matte-1536x1076.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" /></p>
<p><strong><br />
Printed out and Laminated with a Glossy Laminate:</strong></p>
<p>Here is the printed out, glossy laminated version!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-31574 aligncenter" src="https://stickerninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Green-Swatch-Examples-Glossy.png" alt="Laminated with Glossy (Printer's CMYK Conversions)" width="612" height="429" srcset="https://stickerninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Green-Swatch-Examples-Glossy.png 2322w, https://stickerninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Green-Swatch-Examples-Glossy-768x538.png 768w, https://stickerninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Green-Swatch-Examples-Glossy-1536x1076.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We hope these examples offer guidance on what to expect with printing greens!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>We offer a¬†number of specialty vinyls to make your art come to life in a variety of different ways!</h2>
<p>This post will explain how our printing process for these vinyls work, and how you can manipulate your artwork to best utilize the material.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding how basic printing works¬†</strong></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s first begin with how printing from the monitor to the printer works! Let&#8217;s take a look at some art and breakdown what is actually getting printed.</p>
<p>Take note on the white space within the artwork on this file. The red arrows indicate all the white space.</p>
<h2></h2>
<p><center><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-11961 " src="https://sticker.ninja/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PPAW.png" alt="" width="479" height="414" /></center>White space within artwork does not actually get printed. The computer/printer reads this space as negative space and no ink is being used in those spots when it&#8217;s being printed. When printed on regular white material, this negative space will be white. If you were to load up a different color material (for example a red paper), this space will be red instead of white.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Vinyl¬†</strong></p>
<p>This leads us to our next topic- vinyl! We print on top of durable vinyl material, and most of the time this material is white for all our basic kiss/die cut stickers.</p>
<p><center><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-11968" src="https://sticker.ninja/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/CFIT100168-WHT-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></center></p>
<p>Vinyl also comes in many different colors and options. We load up our printer with big rolls of these special vinyls and print directly on top of these materials. The negative/white space in your artwork that we mentioned above, will now default to these colors. The negative space in your artwork will now translate to a holographic/glow-in-the-dark/chrome/clear depending on which option you want to print on!</p>
<p>Other colors in your artwork will be effected by the vinyl color as well. Your colors will take on the effect of the vinyl- a yellow color will become a holographic-y yellow, a red will be a chrome colored red, and so on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Printing with white ink¬†</strong></p>
<p>With these specialty vinyls we have the option of using white ink! White ink is another ink cartridge that some printers have. Printers will only print the white ink if it&#8217;s a spot color within the artwork prep.</p>
<p>White ink will block out the effects of the material it is printed on. We can pick and choose where we want the white ink to be placed on the artwork to create really neat effects with the artwork! How it works is the printer first prints out the layer of white ink for your artwork, followed by printing out the colors in your artwork directly on top of it. Let&#8217;s take a look at how the white ink layer was prepped for the artwork above using 3 different styles of white ink and how it translates to its final sticker form!</p>
<p><em>Example 1:</em></p>
<p><center><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-11963 " src="https://sticker.ninja/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PPAW2.png" alt="" width="376" height="350" /><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-11987" src="https://sticker.ninja/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_5382-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="330" height="330" />¬†<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-11986" src="https://sticker.ninja/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_5381-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="328" height="329" /></center>The white ink layer is represented with a gray color (so we can actually see it!). The white ink layer is around the artwork and not behind any of the colors. This will allow the colors to take on the holographic effect! Remember, any white space in your artwork will take on the holographic vinyl color!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Example 2:</em></p>
<p><center><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-11964 size-full" src="https://sticker.ninja/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Capture3-1.png" alt="" width="420" height="390" />¬†<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-11985 " src="https://sticker.ninja/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_5380-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="381" height="381" /></center>In example 2, there is no white ink layer at all. The artwork is directly printed on top of the special material so you get a blend of the pure holographic color along with the printed colors reacting to the holographic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Example 3:</em></p>
<p><center><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-12000" src="https://sticker.ninja/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2333.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="262" /><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-11984 " src="https://sticker.ninja/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_5379-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="336" height="336" /> <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-11983 " src="https://sticker.ninja/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_5378.JPG-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="336" height="336" /></center>For this example the white ink layer is completely behind the cat&#8217;s face which will block out the effects of the holographic material behind any of the artwork and cause the negative space in the image to be white.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>File Prep</strong></p>
<p>There isn&#8217;t anything special that needs to be done for these specialty stickers! Upload your artwork as normal. Providing the highest res image you have available is helpful for us when it comes to create the white ink layer but not necessary. We have a team of talented designers who are ready to prep your artwork for print! Let us know in the order notes what you are picturing for the specialty vinyl and we&#8217;ll make it happen!</p>
<p>If you are wishing to prep the white ink layer yourself you will need to provide a layered PDF file. Artwork on the first layer and the white ink layer on the second! The white ink layer will need to be in a vector format.</p>
<p><center><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-11967 size-full" src="https://sticker.ninja/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Capture-1-1.png" alt="" width="317" height="130" /></center><strong>Proof¬†</strong></p>
<p>Once you have placed your order, you will receive a proof showing you where the white ink layer will be placed! This will give you an idea of what your finished sticker will look like! You are welcome to decline the proof if you need any changes made <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="üôÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><center><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-12002 aligncenter" src="https://sticker.ninja/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/proof.jpg" alt="" width="298" height="420" /></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We hope you are now a little more educated when it comes to our specialty vinyl and are ready to turn your art into something extra special!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><center></p>
<p>White ink can be applied to any of the materials below:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">What&#8217;s the difference between a full bleed and white border?</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most artwork we receive has the option of either having a full bleed or a white border around the artwork.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-9576" src="https://sticker.ninja/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/45920060_420511101818123_9023719011556322252_n.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="400" />¬†<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-9575" src="https://sticker.ninja/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/49406692_2317352941662972_475547218831407584_n.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="400" /></p>
<p>Left: Full Bleed¬† |¬† Right: White Border</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Artwork for print and cut has three main areas: the Safety Area, Cut Line, and the Bleed.</p>
<p>The main part of your sticker artwork should be in the Safety Area, followed by 1/8&#8243; Safety Margin for the Cut Lines, and the Bleed area that extends out passed the Cut Lines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-9582 alignnone" src="https://sticker.ninja/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Full-Bleed-1.jpg" alt="" width="504" height="400" />¬†<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-9578" src="https://sticker.ninja/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Safety-Margin.jpg" alt="" width="355" height="400" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Why the Bleed?</h3>
<p>Having the artwork extend out passed the Cut Lines helps with any cutting discrepancies when your stickers head to the cutter. It helps ensure that your sticker will be a full bleed and no white vinyl will be showing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Why the Safety Margin?</h3>
<p>The Safety Margin helps with any cutting discrepancies. We automatically add an 1/8&#8243; Safety Margin to your artwork.¬† If you&#8217;re adding your own cutlines, please include that 1/8&#8243; Safety Margin!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Images that don&#8217;t work with Full Bleeds</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not all images work with a Full Bleed and will require a white border. Artwork that is too complex, and was not designed with a bleed in mind, will require a white border.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-9584" src="https://sticker.ninja/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/47121859_1624213881011880_8618781681268239176_n.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="500" />¬†<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-9586" style="font-size: 16px;" src="https://sticker.ninja/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/43071753_565122367271043_2508629324446834393_n.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="500" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Complex Images with a Full Bleed</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To create a full bleed with these images, part of the artwork was cut into for the bleed. Notice that the text and main artwork are still in the Safety Area.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>PDFs are one of our favorite ways to accept artwork!</h1>
<p>They retain all the vector information, making it easy for us to add cutlines to your artwork, or change any of the existing colors of your artwork to any desired spot color.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the downsides of accepting PDFs is that if we don&#8217;t have your font in our system we get the lovely &#8220;Missing Fonts&#8221; alert pops up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-9213 size-full aligncenter" src="https://sticker.ninja/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Capture-1.png" alt="" width="517" height="499" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;What the heck are missing fonts?&#8221; you might be asking yourself and that&#8217;s a wonderful question to ask! If your graphic includes any specialty fonts, fonts you have downloaded or even fonts special to Macintosh or Window computers, then when sending over a PDF or AI file there&#8217;s a good chance our computers aren&#8217;t going to have those fonts already saved. Here&#8217;s where you can be a next level designer and learn how to expand your fonts!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What exactly is an &#8220;expanded font&#8221;?</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An expanded font, also known as an outlined font, is when you take your existing live text and turn it into a shape. Shapes within your file are great because they can easily be shared from computer to computer!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s show an example! Behold, our existing live text in our AI file:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-9214 size-full aligncenter" src="https://sticker.ninja/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Capture2.png" alt="" width="816" height="251" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now we right click on the text and select &#8220;Create Outlines&#8221;.</p>
<p>Alternatively Object &gt; Expand does the same thing!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-9215 size-full aligncenter" src="https://sticker.ninja/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Capture3.png" alt="" width="236" height="356" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And either of these options will turn your text into an object!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-9216 size-full aligncenter" src="https://sticker.ninja/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Capture55.png" alt="" width="807" height="210" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>What if my designer sent me a file without expanded fonts and I don&#8217;t have a way of contacting them?</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No worries, friend! We have a wonderful work around we can use if this is the case. We do appreciate all you artists who can take the time to expand fonts for us but for those who are unable to here&#8217;s a little trick we&#8217;ve learned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Create a new document, File &gt; Place and find the PDF with all those missing fonts.</p>
<p>Once placed it will look something like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-9217 size-full aligncenter" src="https://sticker.ninja/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Capture-2.png" alt="" width="517" height="425" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s time to Flatten Transparency. Go to Object &gt; Flatten Transparency and select the following settings:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-9218 size-full aligncenter" src="https://sticker.ninja/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Capture7.png" alt="" width="440" height="485" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now all those unsaved fonts will be turned into outlines and the PDF file is now usable <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="üôÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for reading along!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Black is one of the most important colors in printing!</h1>
<p>Many people print things in just black and white! Often times designers will go for an off-black color that is currently popular in the design world. However, many people want a dark, rich black. While we have techniques to create a darker and more rich black, using the correct ratios of CMYK will ensure you get the perfect black on your stickers every time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Printing uses a mixture of C-cyan, M-magenta, Y-yellow, and K-black. These colors are combined as tiny dots to make all printable colors you see on your stickers. Many people assume using 100% black will create a rich black.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alas, to provide a true rich black, the printer uses a combination of all four inks. We recommend doing 40, 40, 40, 100 for best results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The difference is huge! You will see an extreme increase in darkness in the black parts of your print!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are using Illustrator there are some settings that really help to set you up for printing success. Here‚Äôs how to set it up:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First go to Edit&gt; Preferences&gt; Appearance of Black:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://sticker.ninja/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/blog1.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="596" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Screen: ‚ÄúDisplay all Black Accurately‚Äù &#8211; This will show you a more realistic interpretation of what your print will actually look like.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://sticker.ninja/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/blog2.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="334" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Printing / Exporting: ‚ÄúOutput All Blacks Accurately‚Äù &#8211; While it seems like outputting all blacks as rich blacks might be a good way to go, we have found that it doesn‚Äôt always translate as expected from design to print. For best results make sure your blacks are always being shown and exported accurately.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So now you know how to properly create rich blacks and off blacks! Congratulations, knowing is half the battle! Good luck out there fellow sticker enthusiasts. For those looking to create a sticker using lots of blacks, we always like to recommend a matte laminate! Matte and black go beautifully together <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="üôÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: left;">What‚Äôs the difference between a ‚Äúkiss cut‚Äù vs a ‚Äúdie cut‚Äù?</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Great question! In the sticker world stickers can either can be kiss or die cut- or we even offer a hybrid of both!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Die cuts refers to when the cut of the sticker goes through both the sticker and the removable backing. Any shape can be a die cut! We suggest going die cut when you‚Äôre looking to sell your stickers, or want a more professional look- the presentation looks much more clean! We especially love doing contour die cut stickers of the unique shape variety. Want a super custom cutline shape? We can do it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Kiss cut stickers are when the cut of the sticker ‚Äúkisses‚Äù the surface leaving the backing uncut. The blade pressure is calibrated perfectly to only pierce the top layer of laminate and vinyl! These are then broken down into square or rectangle shaped end products. The kiss cut can still be any shape you want! The sticker will peel away from the square backing leaving behind ‚Äúwaste space‚Äù. This is a cheaper alternative for those looking to make slaps, or promotional marketing products. One of the best parts about kiss cuts is the ability to utilize the waste space for added information that may not be attractive on the sticker itself. We love this feature and if you need help setting this up, please ask our knowledgeable crew!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/268c02a4cc6fcd01686396194579d24b/5BFF566B/t51.2885-15/e35/37140802_546100299152918_6152474620692791296_n.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The use of waste space can even go one step further which is a combination of both kiss cut and die cut stickers that we refer to as a ‚Äúhybrid‚Äù cut. Why choose just a kiss cut or a die cut when you can have the best of both worlds? Here at Sticker Ninja we have developed methods that allow us to create a die cut sticker with a kiss cutline inside of it that we refer to as a ‚Äúhybrid‚Äù cut. We use these to make our signature business cards! Utilize all the waste space of a sticker, with the professional look of a die cut. It‚Äôs truly the best of both worlds!</p>
