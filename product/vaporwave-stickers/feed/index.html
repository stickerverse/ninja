					<description><![CDATA[I love this vinyl! It has such a nice, soft effect, and the matte finish really ties it all together! Not to mention, it&#039;s high quality and quite sturdy material. My customers love it too (:]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love this material! It&#039;s definitely less intense than the normal holographic - it&#039;s got a lovely silver-y rainbow-y shimmer thing going on that I adore! Great for adding a little pizzaz to any design~]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m in love with my vapour wave stickers (and apparently my customers agree). The effect is gorgeous- more subtle than holographic but just as eye catching. And you did an incredible job transforming my watercolour art into sticker format- they&#039;re next-level amazing!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sticker Ninja never ever disappoints. This effect is so gorgeous and goes great with so many designs. It’s subtle but in the sunlight it’s truly mesmerizing. An underused effect!! We need more vaporwave stickersssssss!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve gotten several different designs with the vaporwave and love all of them- jewel tones are vivid and lush, pastels are pearlescent and delicate. Sticker Ninja does exceptional work and has been really helpful with set up on these- I highly recommend asking for their expert opinion and feedback with this material if you&#039;re trying it out for the first time.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[LOOOOOVE the vaporwave stickers I got. The color is amazing, almost like an oil slick. It&#039;s matte and muted so not as intense as holographic, but very very pleasant to look at. And the print quality from Sticker Ninja is wonderful.]]></description>
