					<description><![CDATA[I LOOOOOOOVE how these stickers turned out. This is my first time ordering from StickerNinja- I can absolutely see myself coming back! They were super nice to initially help me figure out what material I should use for what I wanted to achieve, and they were also so so kind and added some extras in my order! Very happy to be able to give some to my boyfriend and other friends! These just look so great, especially if you get a bright color overlay! So very happy, not much else to say! Thank you so much!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Used this effect to make a “mirror” sticker and it’s incredibly. I felt so inspired when I saw someone else do similar and I feel like this effect has the potential to do so much. I can’t wait to make more chrome stickers!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[These stickers really are incredible! From the quality for the paper to the reflection in the Chrome, everything is perfection! You literally can see yourself in these stickers, it makes everything so shiny. Everyone always compliments me on how they shimmer and reflect so well.]]></description>
