					<description><![CDATA[This was my first time ordering from Sticker Ninja and I&#039;m beyond impressed with both their product quality and their customer service! I ordered 2 different bumper stickers and the colors and print quality are amazing. The matte laminate has a really nice look to it and the easy peel tab makes the sticker look really professional. Definitely an upgrade from my previous manufacturer and I&#039;m sold. I&#039;ll be ordering all of my bumper stickers through Sticker Ninja in the future! Thanks again guys! &#060;3]]></description>
