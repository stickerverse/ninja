					<description><![CDATA[Such a COOL material. I’ve used this to make two stickers (and plan to make many more!) and have purchased stickers from other artists using Sticker Ninja with this effect and the quality is always out of this world. The glow is soooo intensely bright and is very much worth the price point. Even areas printed on will glow depending on how deep the color saturation/hue is there!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I LOVE these stickers - I also have to keep re-ordering them to keep them in stock! Several friends have reported being delightfully frightened by their bright glow when they forget the stickers are in the room LOL. But seriously SO BRIGHT and so beautiful and long-lasting. Thank you Sticker Ninja!]]></description>
