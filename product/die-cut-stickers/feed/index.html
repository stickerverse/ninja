					<description><![CDATA[Sticker Ninja is always my go-to for stickers because of both their amazing quality in stickers as well as their equally amazing customer service and production team. The colors come out vibrant and they look extremely close to how they appear on my screen, so I donâ€™t have to second guess or worry about the final end product. I usually go with the Matte Contour for die cut stickers, though Iâ€™ve also been having a lot of fun with their other product options. 100/10 would recommend for anyone wanting to try making stickers, or looking for an awesome and reliable company! ;u;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I consistently order these stickers time and time again. I&#039;ve reccommended Sticker Ninja to every single serious merch maker I know. The company ethics are flawless, the staff is extremely kind, and I&#039;ve yet to recieve a sticker that was anything even remotely south of superior quality. I use the Countour cut matte finish mostly as bumperstickers. Ive never heard any complaints about peeling, fading, or scratching. One guy once told me that he got rear-ended- twice. Had to get his bumper hammered out- twice. *The Sticker Stayed, Entirely Unharmed. BOTH TIMES.* If that&#039;s not a quality testament, I don&#039;t know what is.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Their quality is impeccable on every product I&#039;ve tested/seen, and their customer service is just as good. I fully switched over from my other, less reliable printer and I&#039;ve never been more happy with a decision!]]></description>
