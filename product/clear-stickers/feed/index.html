					<description><![CDATA[These stickers are the absolute best!! I have one on the back of my car and it is going strong for over a year of rain, heat, snow, and hail! The colors are always exactly how they look on my screen when i draw them too, which is really impressive if you’ve ever had to print anything with color! Highly recommend these stickers.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am not obsessed with clear stickers. I had a detailed little ghostly sticker to print and the detail put into the white ink allocation was phenomenal. I put the sticker on my giant mason jar of water I use to force myself to hydrate and I almost scared myself thinking a REAL GHOST had fallen into my drinking vessel! Fear not! It was just Sticker Ninja’s ability to retain perfect detail form designs onto the sticker material . Bravo!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve probably ordered about 15 different Clear stickers from Sticker Ninja and they are by far my most popular stickers. The quality is second to non, and the fact that you also get the option of semi-transparent... that&#039;s very cool!!!!]]></description>
