					<description><![CDATA[I had two different designs printed with this prismatic effect, and both turned out absolutely stunning. The effect adds such an amazing pop when contrasted against the matte part of the sticker. These stickers are gorgeous and I cannot recommend them enough! I will definitely order more stickers with this amazing effect!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love the chaotic energy of the prisms - it&#039;s such a fun look to contrast against with the white ink layer. Absolutely one of my favorite materials!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[These came out even better than I expected!! I really love how each one was unique due to the way the material is, and I found myself picking out a few that I really liked because of the way they sparkled. Really lovely material, it almost reminds me of scales, and I just cant get enough pictures of my stickers! Will definitely be ordering again! Thank you so much for printing these! &#060;3]]></description>
